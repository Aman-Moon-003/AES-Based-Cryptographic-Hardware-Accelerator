# AES-Based-Cryptographic-Hardware-Accelerator
**Overview:**
This repository contains the implementation of an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) based hardware accelerator using [FPGA/VLSI platform], designed to efficiently perform encryption and decryption operations. The project explores hardware optimization techniques for cryptographic systems, focusing on high-performance and secure AES encryption in hardware.

AES is a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm that supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, making it robust for various cryptographic applications. The hardware accelerator in this project improves the throughput and reduces latency, making it suitable for applications like secure communications, IoT, and secure data storage.

**Features:**
1. AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 Support: This hardware accelerator supports multiple key sizes for AES encryption/decryption.
2. High Performance: The design is optimized for speed and low latency.
3. FPGA Implementation: The accelerator is implemented on an FPGA platform to utilize hardware parallelism.
4. Resource Efficient: It minimizes resource usage while ensuring high throughput.
5. Configurable Key Length: Allows flexibility to choose different AES key lengths.

**Project Architecture:**
The hardware accelerator design is composed of the following key modules:
1. Key Expansion Module: Generates round keys from the original key for each AES round.
2. Encryption Module: Performs AES encryption using a combination of SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey transformations.
3. Decryption Module: Executes AES decryption with inverse transformations.
4. Control Unit: Manages the flow of data through encryption/decryption and synchronization.
5. Testbench: Includes a testbench to verify the functionality of the accelerator through simulation.
